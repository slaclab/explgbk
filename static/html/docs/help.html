This application is the main UI for the data management infrastructure (aka <b>DM</b>) and hosts a variety of application frontends.
Details for these applications are available after a brief overview of the system.
If you have any questions, please email <span class="hh"><a href="mailto:pcds-datamgt-l@slac.stanford.edu">pcds-datamgt-l@slac.stanford.edu</a></span>.
Please include the experiment name and any other details that may be relevant.

<h6 class="st">Overview</h6>
<p>In
    <span class="site_LCLS">LCLS,</span>
    <span class="site_CryoEM">CryoEM,</span>
    <span class="site_TestFac">Test Facilties,</span>
experiments take data in units of <i>runs</i>.
The DAQ initiates a run by first getting a run number from the DM and then sending a signal to its various components to start recording.
At the end of the run (typically user initiated), the files containing these various datasets are closed.
A run is also the unit of analysis; for example, given the run number, psana has API's that get a detector's data for an experiment.</p>
<p>As part of every run, the DAQ stores the detector and other data (typically EPICS) in files associated with the run.
These files are registered in the DM for the run and are displayed in the <span class="hhb">File Manager</span>.
In addition, the DAQ also registers some of the metadata with the DM system to facilitate visualization and searching.
Custom <span class="hhb">Run Tables</span> can be defined to offer tabular views of this metadata.
In addition, simple histograms and scatter charts are also supported.</p>
<p>The DM also lets you group together runs into logical run groups called <span class="hhb">Samples</span>.
Any number of samples can be defined ( one sample per grad student perhaps? ).
There is a notion of a current sample and new runs are automatically associated with the current sample.
The current sample also serves as a filter in the UI; for example, run data, files eLog entries etc are restricted to the current sample in the UI.
See the <a href="#samples"><span class="hhb">Samples</span></a> documentation to see how the UI can be configured to display data from other samples.
</p>
<p class="site_LCLS">Once a run is complete, the DM can automatically kick off analysis jobs in either SLAC's psana/SDF analysis farms or on larger HPC facilities like NERSC.
Analysis jobs can be configured using the <span class="hhb">Workflow</span>/<span class="hhb">Definitions</span> tab and can be monitored using the <span class="hhb">Workflow</span>/<span class="hhb">Control</span> tab.
These analysis jobs can generate further metadata to be displayed using <span class="hhb">Run Tables</span> or HTML documents that can be displayed in the <span class="hhb">Summaries</span> tab.</p>
<p>For the operational side of things, you can keep track of the progress of your experiment using a electronic logbook in the <span class="hhb">eLog</span>.
The eLog supports attachments, emails, tags and Slack integration.
<p>Finally, experiments are all about collaboration. Add/remove/manage your collaborators using the <span class="hhb">Collaborators</span> page.</p>
</div>

<h6 class="st" id="runTables">Run Tables</h6>
As part of each run, the DAQ uploads some of the metadata for the run into the DM.
This metadata can be viewed in a tabular fashion using customizable run tables.
<div class="sut">Create a new run table</div>
To define a new run table, please click on the <i class="fa-solid fa-plus fa-lg ic"></i> toolbar button on the top right hand corner.
You can choose any number of metadata items using the table in the dialog.
There are several categories of metadata items.
<ul>
    <li><span class="hh">Run Info</span> items refer to aspects of the run like the start time, sample name etc.</li>
    <li><span class="hh">Editables</span> refers to user editable items; typically text boxes for adding comments to a run.</li>
    <li><span class="hh">Misc</span> includes look and feel items like separators etc.</li>
    <li><span class="hh">EPICS:*</span> refers to items uploaded by the DAQ. These are often categorized and labelled by the POC. For example, <span class="hh">EPICS:Electron and Photon Beams</span> refer to EPICS PV's that contain the electron and photon beam information.</li>
    <li><span class="hh">EPICS:Additional parameters</span> refers to all other items uploaded by the DAQ.</li>
</ul>

<div class="sut">Run table types</div>
Several kinds of run tables are supported.
<ul>
    <li><span class="hh">Table</span> This table type displays the run metadata in a simple tabular fashion.</li>
    <li><span class="hh">Histogram</span> This table type displays the data for a column as a histogram; the bin size can be specified as part of the table definition.</li>
    <li><span class="hh">Scatter</span> This table type display one or more metadata values as a scatter chart. The first column in the table definition is used as the x-axis while the other columns are plotted against the first column.</li>
    <li><span class="hh">Generated table</span> This table type is typically used to display all columns whose parameter names (EPICS PV names) match a regular expression.
        This is typically used in cases where the actual metadata names are unknown but follow a naming convention.
        For example, using <span class="hhb">DAQ.*</span> as the pattern will match all metadata generated by the DAQ about the DAQ (total events etc) and will result in a run table thats shows all DAQ related metadata.
    </li>
    <li><span class="hh">Group by table</span> This table type can be used to group runs.
        In a regular run table, data is presented with one row per run.
        In a group by table, data is presented with one row per metadata value and the list of runs with that value is the final column in the table.
        For example, one can tag run's with a <span class="hhb">Data_Quality</span> tag with values of <span class="hhb">Good</span>, <span class="hhb">Bad</span> and <span class="hhb">Ugly</span>.
        A group by table grouped on the <span class="hhb">Data_Quality</span> column will have three rows.
        <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-condensed"><tr><th>Data_Quality</th><th>Runs</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Good</td><td>4, 5, 6, 7, 8</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Bad</td><td>3</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Ugly</td><td>1, 2</td></tr>
        </table>

    </li>
</ul>


The <i class="fa-solid fa-plus fa-lg ic"></i> and <i class="fa-solid fa-trash fa-lg ic"></i> buttons can be used to add and remove metadata items from the run table.
The <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up fa-lg ic"></i> and <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-down fa-lg ic"></i> buttons can be used to reorder the metadata items in the run table.

<div class="sut">Other run table operations</div>
Use the <i class="fa-solid fa-edit fa-lg ic"></i> toolbar button to edit existing an existing run table, the <i class="fa-solid fa-clone fa-lg ic"></i> toolbar button to clone an existing run table and <i class="fa-solid fa-trash fa-lg ic"></i> toolbar button to delete an existing run table.

<div class="sut">System run tables</div>
Some run tables are defined as system wide run tables; that is, they are available to all experiments.
As these tables are visible to all experiments, changes to these run tables are restricted to lab personnel.
<div class="priv_ops_page">
To change a system run table,
<ol>
    <li>In any experiment, clone the system run table as new table in that experiment. This will copy the table definition from the system run tables to this experiment.</li>
    <li>Edit the cloned run table. Validate that the changes are working correctly.</li>
    <li>Use the <i class="fa-solid fa-globe fa-lg ic"></i> icon to publish the edited run table to the system run tables.
        This will move the table definition from the experiment to the system run tables (the table definition will be removed from this experiment).</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h6 class="st" id="eLog">eLog</h6>
This application also hosts an electronic notebook that can be used to make notes on and keep track of your experiment.
In addition to simple text, the eLog lets you upload attachments, add HTML formatted comments, tag your entries, automatically email entries and automatically publish entries onto Slack.
Sophisticated search using text indexes is also available.
The system automatically adds entries for run start and run stop to help with visualizing timelines.
If these entries are getting in the way, you can turn them on/off using the <i class="fa-solid fa-running fa-lg ic"></i> icon in the toolbar.
<div class="sut">Creating a new log entry</div>
Use the <i class="fa-solid fa-plus fa-lg ic"></i> toolbar button to create a new log entry.
The new entry can optionally be associated with a run. The system will fill in the most recent run automatically for you; you can change or remove this.
You can also specify any number of space separated tags in the <span class="hh">Tags</span> textbox.
Tags can be used to categorize your entries; for example, entries that may be useful to present at the ACR 8AM meetings.
Some tags are used to identify support issues and roadblocks; the checkboxes for support issues and roadblocks use the same tags.
Elog entries can also be cc'ed to people's inboxes by adding their email address to the <span class="hh">Email</span> textbox when posting new entries.
You can also have eLog entries automatically emailed to you by subscribing to receive automated e-mail notifications using the <i class="fa-solid fa-inbox fa-lg ic"></i> icon in the toolbar.
<div class="sut">Attachments</div>
The system lets you upload any number of attachments to an eLog message.
Whenever possible, thumbnails are generated and used during display of the eLog message.
A useful feature of the eLog is a mode where only the attachment thumbnails are displayed using the <i class="fa-solid fa-paperclip fa-lg ic"></i> toolbar button.
This is a quick way to locate a eLog entry based on a screenshot etc.
<div class="sut">Edits/Deletes</div>
In addition to infinitely nested followups, the eLog supports logical deletes/edits of eLog entries.
Deleted entries are displayed using strikethru characters.
When editing entries, the existing entry is logically deleted and displayed using strikethru characters.
Use the <i class="fa-solid fa-strikethrough fa-lg ic"></i> to hide deleted entries from view.
<div class="sut">Searching</div>
Support for full text search is available in addition to searching by run numbers, dates etc.
<ul>
    <li>To search for any text (non-numeric), simply type in the text. Text matches are made against the message text, message titles, tags and author names. For example, typing <span class="hhb">temp</span> in the search bar will match elog entries with the tag temp and also an entry with the message &quot;Moving to the (+1) Room temp&quot;</li>
    <li>The underlying full text search engine uses spaces to separate words and phrases. Adding a terminal space to your search term (for example, &quot;trim &quot;)is often useful in narrowing your search results. </li>
    <li>To search for an exact phrase, enclose the search term in quotes. For example, the search term <span class="hhb">large clusters</span> will return full text search results for entries with the word <span class="hhb">large</span> and the word <span class="hhb">clusters</span>. Whereas the search term <span class="hhb">&quot;large clusters&quot;</span> will return entries that contain the entire phrase <span class="hhb">large clusters</span>.</li>
    <li class="site_LCLS site_TestFac">To search for a run or a range or runs, enter the numeric run number or range of run numbers. For example, typing <span class="hhb">37</span> in the search box will search for elog entries associated with the run 37. Typing <span class="hhb">37-39</span> will search for elog entries associated with the run's 37, 38 and 39.</li>
    <li>To search for a date or range of dates, type in the date (or range) using a MM/DD/YYYY format. For example, typing <span class="hhb">11/25/2018</span> in the search box will search for elog entries made on Nov 25th 2018. Typing <span class="hhb">11/23/2018-11/29/2018</span> in the search box will search for elog entries made between Nov 23rd 2018 and Nov 29th 2018.</li>
    <li>There is limited support for regex searching. To match a regex in the elog, prefix with the string <span class="hhb">x:</span> and then type in the regex. For example, the search string <span class="hhb">x:^.*Cu.*SHOT.*$</span> searches for the regex <span class="hhb">^.*Cu.*SHOT.*$</span> and will match an entry with the string <span class="hhb">Cu grating regular, SHOT!</span>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="sut">Instrument eLog's</div>
In some facilities, the instrument/beamline personnel maintain a separate eLog for the instrument.
It is often useful to cross-post eLog entries to the instrument eLog(s) as a means of communication with the instrument/beamline scientists.
You can cross-post to the instrument eLog(s) when posting a new elog entry or use the <i class="fa-solid fa-mail-bulk fa-lg ic"></i> icon to cross-post an existing entry.

<h6 class="st" id="fileManager">File Manager</h6>
<p>This application also hosts the front end for the file catalog and the data movement infrastructure.
As part of each run, the DAQ registers each file that has data with the DM.
The <span class="hhb">File Manager</span> tab displays the files containing data for the experiment grouped by the runs.
<div class="site_LCLS">
<div class="sut">Location</div>
<p>LCLS supports the ability to move and analyze data at other facilities (for example, NERSC).
This is done using locations; a location is a logical name for a facility where the data movers can move data to for analysis.
For example, the data movers might initially make the data available at the PCDS psana cluster.
This shows up as the location <span class="hhb">SLAC</span> in the <span class="hhb">File Manager</span>.
The data is usually held at this location for a few weeks/months after which it is deleted to make way for other experiments.
To restore data from the tape archive at the <span class="hhb">SLAC</span> location, click on the button for the <span class="hhb">SLAC</span> location in the <span class="hhb">File Manager</span>.
This should check the data movers for the current status of the run's files at this location and offer up an option to make the data available at this location.
In addition to <span class="hhb">SLAC</span>, support for <span class="hhb">NERSC</span> and <span class="hhb">SDF</span> locations is available as part of the DM.
</p>
</div>
</p>

<h6 class="st" id="samples">Samples</h6>
This application supports the ability to logically group runs into run groups called samples.
For example, samples can be used to group together/distinguish runs for different strains of a virus, different experimental conditions or even different grad students.
The relationship between a run and a sample is purely logical and can thus be adopted for whatever use serves you best.
To create a sample, use the <i class="fa-solid fa-plus fa-lg ic"></i> toolbar button.
A sample is just a name, description and any number of name/value pairs.
<div class="sut">Current sample</div>
The application support the notion of a <span class="hhb">&quot;current&quot; sample</span>.
All new runs are automatically associated with the &quot;current&quot; sample.
To make a sample current, use the <i class="fa-solid fa-play fa-lg ic"></i> button.
The &quot;current&quot; sample is displayed at the top center of the page next to the experiment name and the  <i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake fa-lg ic"></i> icon.
Since files, elog entries and run metadata are associated with runs and runs are (optionally) associated with samples, samples provide a way to focus the DM application on a sample.
By default, the application will display files, elog entries and run table metadata only for those runs associated with the current sample.
To display files, elog entries and run table metadata for another sample or for all samples, click on the sample name next to the <i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake fa-lg ic"></i> icon.
This should bring up a dialog that lets you change the sample for the UI.
Note this does <b>not</b> change the <span class="hhb">&quot;current&quot; sample</span> in the system; it only changes the sample being used as a filter in the UI.
To actually change the <span class="hhb">&quot;current&quot; sample</span> in the system, please use the <i class="fa-solid fa-play fa-lg ic"></i> button for that sample.
<div class="site_CryoEM">
<div class="sut">Sample parameters</div>
<p>
In CryoEM, when creating new samples, the system will prompt for predefined parameters that are needed to operate the microscopes and analyze the data accurately.
Some of these are required; this is indicated with a <span class="text-danger">*</span> next to the label.
If unsure of what these parameters mean, please ask the instrument operators.
</p>
</div>

<div class="site_LCLS">
<h6 class="st" id="lcls_wf_defs">Workflows</h6><span id="lcls_wf_jobs"></span>
<div>
In LCLS, the system supports the ability to automatically trigger analysis jobs on data movement events.
A job definition consists of
<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Executable - For more information, please see the ARP (automatic run processing) section in the psana documentation.</li>
    <li>Any number of name-value pairs that are passed as parameters to the executable</li>
    <li>A location where the job is to be initiated. See the <span class="hhb">File Manager</span> documentation for more details on locations</li>
    <li>A data movement trigger that initiates the job</li>
</ul>
The following data movement triggers are supported
<ul>
    <li>At the start of a run</li>
    <li>At the end of a run</li>
    <li>When the first file for a run is transferred and available at the location</li>
    <li>When all files for a run are transferred and available at the location</li>
    <li>Manually initiated from the UI</li>
</ul>
The status of jobs can be monitored at a high level using the <span class="hhb">Workflow</span>/<span class="hhb">Control</span> tab.
This tab offers the ability to kill a running job, view the log files and job details from a job.
In addition to job status from the batch system, this tab also offers the ability to update the job specific status in realtime using the ARP API.
</div>
</div>

<h6 class="st" id="collaborators">Collaborators</h6>
This tab support the addition and removal of collaboratos from the experiment.
Use the <i class="fa-solid fa-user fa-lg ic"></i> to add individual users and the <i class="fa-solid fa-users fa-lg ic"></i> to add groups (LDAP groups) of users.
<ul>
    <li>The <i class="fa-solid fa-pencil-alt fa-lg ic"></i> gives permission to post new data to the system.</li>
    <li>The <i class="fa-solid fa-edit fa-lg ic"></i> gives permission to make changes to existing data.</li>
    <li>The <i class="fa-solid fa-gavel fa-lg ic"></i> gives permission to add/remove collaborators.</li>
</ul>
