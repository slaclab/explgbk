<h4>Role based authorization.</h4>
<div>
This application uses role based access control (RBAC) for authorization. Briefly, RBAC uses the concepts of
<dl>
 <dt><span class="text-primary">Privileges</span></dt><dd>
    Privileges are a set of strings that are the units of authorization.
    API calls and pages in the application are often tagged with a privilege; the logged in user must have that privilege in order to execute the API call/get the contents the page.
    For example, the <code>switch_experiment</code> API call is tagged with the <code>switch</code> privilege.
    Thus, only users who have the <code>switch</code> are allowed to make the <code>switch_experiment</code> API call and activate experiments.
 </dd>
 <dt><span class="text-primary">Users and Groups</span></dt><dd>
    The application consults the site LDAP for a list of users, groups and group memberships.
    For each logged in user, the set of groups that the user belongs to is obtained.
    The userid of the user is also added to this set by prepending the prefix "uid:" to the userid.
    For example, if the user <code>jdoe</code> is a member of the groups <code>ps-editors, ps-pocs</code>,
    the set of groups for the logged in user is computed to be <code>[uid:jdoe, ps-editors, ps-pocs]</code>
 </dd>
 <dt><span class="text-primary">Roles</span></dt><dd>
    Roles are objects that reflect the organizational structure/functional hierarchies in your department/site.
    For example, in many departments that use this application, there are a group of people who manage/maintain the schedules for the instruments.
    These folks typically create and switch experiments but may not necessarily be involved in the day to day data gathering.
    So, there may be a role called <code>LabPersonnel</code> that reflects this function.
    Another example, in all experiments, there is a principal investigator (PI).
    The PI is the one who decides who is to be as a collaborator on an specific experiment.
    So, there is a role called <code>Manager</code> that reflects this function and the PI is automatically added to this role when the experiment is initially registered.
 </dd>
</div>
<p>Roles tie the other two comcepts together.
Each role has a list of privileges that the users who play that role are entitled to.
For example, users who play the <code>Manager</code> role inherit these privileges <code>[manage_groups, read, post, edit, delete]</code>.
The set of privileges associated with the role is defined during application installation and only changes during application upgrades.
</p>
<p>Each role is also associated with a list of user/groups who play that role.
This is a more dynamic list and is controlled using various user interfaces.
This association is also permitted at different levels of the application.
An user/LDAP group can be associated with the role at a global, instrument or experiment level.
<ul>
    <li>If the association is at an experiment level, then the user inherits the privileges of the role for just that experiment.</li>
    <li>If the association is at an instrument level, then the user inherits the privileges of the role for all experiments for that instrument.</li>
    <li>If the association is at an global level, then the user inherits the privileges of the role for all experiments.</li>
</ul>
</p>
This is a list of privileges currently in use in the system.
<ul>
    <li><code>read</code> - To read the contents of an experiment.</li>
    <li><code>post</code> - To post new entries to the log book, run parameters, file catalog etc.</li>
    <li><code>edit</code> - To change existing entries to the log book, run parameters, file catalog etc.</li>
    <li><code>delete</code> - To delete existing entries to the log book, run parameters, file catalog etc.</li>
    <li><code>feedback_read</code> - To read the POC feedback after the experiment completes.</li>
    <li><code>feedback_write</code> - To edit/change the POC feedback after the experiment completes.</li>
    <li><code>manage_groups</code> - To add user/groups to a role for the experiment.</li>
    <li><code>ops_page</code> - To access the ops dashboard.</li>
    <li><code>switch</code> - To activate an experiment on an instrument.</li>
    <li><code>experiment_create</code> - To register new experiments.</li>
    <li><code>experiment_edit</code> - To change already registered experiments.</li>
    <li><code>experiment_delete</code> - To delete/archive registered experiments.</li>
    <li><code>instrument_create</code> - To create new instrument.</li>
</ul>
